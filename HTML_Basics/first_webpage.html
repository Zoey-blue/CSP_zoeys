        <h1>Art is so intersting</h1>
        <h2>Why Art?</h2>
        <p> Art is very general but I love all of it, Painting, sculpting, writing, danceing, and music. Art feeds the soul and there is so much art everywhere in the world it's all so amazing. I think that all of the differnt form can can touch so many different people. Everyone should try a form or art, the product dosen't have to be good but just try.</p>
        <h3>How All Art is Cool</h3>
        <p>Painting, painting a image that speaks to you and loving everything about it because it is so unique is beutuful. Scuplting how people can have a block of clay and turn into a masterpeice is crazy, it is very hands on and takes skill to learn and master. There are so many differnt meadims that you can scult in like stone, clay, wood they all take skill and practice to make look good. Music, it can reach so many differnt people and it's so beautiful to see when you get to connect through music through the lyrics. </p>
