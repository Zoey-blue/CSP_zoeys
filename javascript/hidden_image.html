        <p> There are lots of colors in the world. Colors we have never even seen before. I think that there is a kind of mistery to not being able to see all hte colors htat are ou there. There are some animals that can see more colors than us as humnans. there are some animals tht can't see any colors and some forced to live in an envierment lacking colors. </p>
        <p> The differnt color and differnt way we humans see things is crazy. I think it is sad that some animals can't see colors. I must think htat becuase I have never lived in a world without colors. Amianls that have never expericed color don't miss it becuase they have nothing to miss. But I think about all the colors other animals can see that we can't, why do I miss something that I've never expericed. Maybe becuae I understand the impact color has on human life, and animals can't understnad that or maybe they can. </p>
